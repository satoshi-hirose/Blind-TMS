# Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex interferes with foot movements in blind individuals: MATLAB codes and related data
This repository contains MATLAB condes and related data to reproduce the figures and related analyses in the paper "Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex interferes with foot movements in blind individuals" by Ikegami, Hirashima, Naito, Hirose (2021). It also contains one supplementary information file.  

The data folder includes the peak dorsiflexion times in all trials for all participants (PeakTime.mat) and an sample data for the elevation angle of the foot movement (SampleData.mat). The code folder includes 'DrawFig.m' to reproduce Figs. 2, 3, S1, and S2 using the peak time data (PeakTime.mat) and 'PeakDetect.m' to identify the peaks using the sameple data of the elevation angle (SampleData.mat). The supplementary information explains the data excluded from analysis.
